                DRAKOS: OPENS UP ABOUT THE LIFE OF A LEAGUE OF LEGENDS ESPORTS CASTER AND BEHIND THE SCENES INFO.
              </p>
                
              <p>
                 <strong>During the week the team has meetings about how to approach the next broadcast—can you share what those meetings look like?</strong> 
                 So, on Tuesday people will pitch their new, crazy ideas. Things like the cooking show, the DnD thing we did, that all gets cooked up on Tuesdays. But most of the work happens on Wednesday. We sit together in a room with our producer and talk about the segments we'll be doing, who will appear when and so on. We'll say what we want to talk about—for example when you're on an analyst desk—and they ask what they can do to help us with it. Whether it's pulling up replays, graphics... Basically: how can we make the coolest sh*it possible?
              </p>
      
              <p>
                <strong>On broadcast, you all are professional and the atmosphere seems great. Do you guys hang out a lot during offtime as well?</strong>
                Sure! I would say that we all get along. The thing about casting is: you don't have to be best friends, but you do need a good work relationship. You definitely have to be closer than just being colleagues. I would like to think that we're all friends, definitely. You know, some people hang out more with each other than others. For example, Frosk and Vedius live in the same house, so they spend a lot of time together. I see Ender a decent amount of time. But I think pretty much everyone is always down to hang out.
                <p>
      
              <p>
                <strong>How was life when you were still living in America?</strong>
                
                It was pretty weird. I worked 35, 40 hours a week at a coffee place while doing esports on the side. All my esports friends were online. We'd play together, Skype together and make content together, but I didn't see those people. Esports was work, and it was a grind. Anytime I wasn't working on esports or working in the coffee shop, I was hanging out with friends. It was a very different pace. Also, it was the city I grew up in, so the friends you have there are a bit different. You grew up with them, and here in Berlin I've met people as an adult.


            </p>
      
              <p>
                <strong>Of the other casters, who is the best in League of Legends?</strong> 
                Ender. That's so easy. He is, like, the only good League player on our team. There are a bunch of people who are in low Diamond. I'm trash. Froskurinn is a hard grinder and she goes from really good to really bad, depending on how tilted she is. Quickshot is full old man status at this point. He plays ARAMs but doesn't take Snowball, for some reason. He plays a lot of TFT too—he does his own thing, shoutout to him. Medic is good, Yamato is good, Vedius is good. But Ender is definitely the best.
              <p>
                <strong>Do you have any words for your colleagues, your fellow on-air talent.</strong> 
                I'd like to think that I'm the kind of person that tells them directly how much I appreciate them. But again: I'm very fortunate to work on what I think is the best team in esports. I think we have the best broadcast team in the world for any esport, and I'm not just talking about casters.
